                        <h2>Design against systemic racism</h2>
                        <p>
                            The second challenge I had to face came up after a discussion I had
                            with an interviewee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was explaining to me that he felt discriminated in the past on
                            some social networks because of his skin color: he was not able to
                            find drivers on a famous French carpooling application. After
                            switching his
                            profile picture to a white man, he was able to find drivers way
                            easily. And it triggered my reflexion even further.
                        </p>
                        <p class="quote mt-2 mb-2">
                            You don't make friends with
                            people because of their skin color, or because of their profile picture.
                            You make friends with people because they share values or interests
                            with you.
                        </p>
                        <p>This assumption was validated by my survey results, so I decided to
                            <b>&nbsp;remove any information that could trigger systemic
                                discrimination</b>: name, profile picture, nationality, occupation
                            etc.

                        <p>Of course I started with a paper prototype that I've tested on 2
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Then I jumped into a mid-fi prototype that I tested in Maze.</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="quote mt-2 mb-2">66 people tested the Mid-fi prototype</p>
                        <p>
                            It helped me to identify the critical elements to display on the
                            screen, and to make a list of what was missing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, since there is no profile picture, I had to add a way for
                            people to recognize each other (eg: I will wear a red scarf).
